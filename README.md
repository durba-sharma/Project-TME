Sentiment Analysis for Restaurant Reviews  
# Project Overview  
This project focuses on classifying restaurant reviews as either positive or negative, leveraging both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in understanding customer feedback for the restaurant industry.  
**Implemented Models**

**Na√Øve Bayes (NB):** Serves as the baseline model, utilizing the Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation.  
**LSTM with Embedding Layers:** Captures sequential dependencies and enhances semantic understanding.  
  
**Features**  
Preprocessing steps (tokenization, stemming, etc.).  
Implementation of Bag-of-Words and embedding-based models.  
Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve.  
Pre-trained model fine-tuning.  
  
**Setup Instructions**  
Clone the Repository  
Download Dataset  
  
**Training the Model**  
Open the python script  
Run the script to preprocess data, train the models, and evaluate results  
Adjust hyperparameters as needed (e.g., epochs, learning rate) in the code.  
# Visualizations
**Confusion Matrix:** Provides classification insights.  
**ROC Curve:** Highlights model performance.  
**Sample Outputs:** Displays actual vs. predicted sentiment for validation.
